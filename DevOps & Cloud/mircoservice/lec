mircoservice architecture

what is monoltihic
decompose ? 
mircoservice talk to each other using APIS
DNS - -we can't remember IPs ; dns servers 
when u buy router at home ? come to home then on your laptop they do configuration one of that is IP adreess of dns server 
from dns server req goes to load balancer. ---> mostly it goes to authentication & authorization(multiple instances) --> real microservice   (microservice communication)
why coming multiple isntances not getting it ? ---
if 2 instance i add data in one will its show in another ? explain in deep ? 
there should be load balancer between each service ? 



diff between authorization and authentication?
3 access of scalabilty ? 
why one db for everything will become bottleneck ? why need indpendent dbs ? 
what is redis ?  in memory store 
sql vs nosql 
no sql db catergory ?  --- 4  category 
wht is api 
wht is service discovery ? .
microservice can talk to each other --- sync comm and unsync comm 
where is eventually consistent .. explain with example 
pub subs model and queue model in unsync comm  explain these model 
why dont need load balancer in both these models ? 
API gateway ? 
event sycning ? 
why in sync comm we always neeed to have load balancer? and on opposite why not ? 
logs? -- 
why in microservice world we exteralise the lod ,don't but it in same service ? tool for it are ?
