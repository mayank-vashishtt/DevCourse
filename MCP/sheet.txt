Model Context Protocol 

The translator is like an MCP!

Model context protocol (MCP) is a standardized interface and framework that
allows AI models to seamlessly interact with external tools, resources, and
environments.


The problem
infamous M×N integration problem.
Essentially, if you have M different AI applications and N different tools/data
sources, you could end up needing M × N custom integrations.

MCP tackles this by introducing a standard interface in the middle. Instead of M
× N direct integrations, we get M + N implementations: each of the M AI

The Host is the user-facing AI application, the environment where the AI model
lives and interacts with the user.(OpenAI’s ChatGPT interface or Anthropic’s
Claude desktop app),

Host is the one that initiates connections to the available MCP servers when the
system needs them. It captures the user's input, keeps the conversation history,
and displays the model’s replies.

The MCP Client is a component within the Host that handles the low-level
communication with an MCP Server.

Think of the Client as the adapter or messenger. While the Host decides what to
do, the Client knows how to speak MCP to actually carry out those instructions
with the server.

The MCP Server is the external program or service that actually provides the
capabilities (tools, data, etc.) to the application.

Servers can run locally on the same machine as the Host or remotely on some
cloud service since MCP is designed to support both scenarios seamlessly.



Tools, prompts and resources form the three core capabilities of the MCP
framework.

Tools are what they sound like: functions that do something on behalf of the AI
model. These are typically operations that can have effects or require
computation beyond the AI’s own capabilities.


Resources provide read-only data to the AI model.
These are like databases or knowledge bases that the AI can query to get
information, but not modify.
Unlike tools, resources typically do not involve heavy computation or side effects,
since they are often just information lookup.

Prompts in the MCP context are a special concept: they are predefined prompt
templates or conversation flows that can be injected to guide the AI’s behavior.
