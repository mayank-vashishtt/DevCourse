# Full Database Concepts (Beginner → Advanced)

This is a complete, detailed and expanded version of all database topics you asked for.

# ✅ 1. What Are Graph-Based Databases? (With Deep Explanation)

Graph databases are **NoSQL databases** designed to store highly connected data.

### ✅ How Data Is Stored

* **Nodes** → Entities (like User, Product, Movie)
* **Edges** → Relationships (FRIENDS_WITH, PURCHASED, FOLLOWS)
* **Properties** → Key–value pairs attached to nodes/edges

### ✅ Why Graph Databases Exist

Relational databases struggle with:

* Many-to-many relationships
* Multi-hop traversal (friends of friends of friends…)
* Social network–like structures

Graphs make these queries **extremely fast**.

### ✅ Where They Fit in Database Categories

They are a branch of **NoSQL Databases**:

* Key-value DB
* Document DB
* Wide-column DB
* **Graph DB ✅**

### ✅ Examples

* Neo4j
* Amazon Neptune
* JanusGraph
* ArangoDB (multi-model)

# ✅ 2. What Are Composite Keys in SQL Databases?

A **composite key** is a primary key made using **multiple columns**.

### ✅ Example

A student can join multiple courses, but not the same course twice:

| student_id | course_id |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 101        | CS101     |
| 101        | MATH02    |

Here, **student_id + course_id** uniquely identifies the row.

### ✅ Why Composite Keys?

* Natural uniqueness
* Used in mapping tables (many-to-many)

### ✅ Downsides

* Makes foreign keys long
* More complex indexing

---

# ✅ 3. Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling (With Real Examples)

## ✅ Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up)

Increase the power of the same machine: more RAM, more CPU.

### Best for:

* **SQL Databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle)

### Advantages

* Simple
* Strong ACID support

### Disadvantages

* Hardware limits
* Expensive beyond a point

---

## ✅ Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out)

Add multiple machines to distribute data.

### Best for:

* **NoSQL Databases** (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB)

### Advantages

* Infinite scaling
* Fault tolerance

### Disadvantages

* Complex architecture
* Eventual consistency issues sometimes

---

# ✅ 4. What Is an ER Diagram?

ER Diagram (Entity–Relationship Diagram) is a visual representation of your database design.

### ✅ Contains:

* **Entities** (tables)
* **Attributes** (columns)
* **Relationships**

  * One-to-One
  * One-to-Many
  * Many-to-Many

### ✅ Purpose

* Database planning
* Understanding relationships
* Normalization

---

# ✅ 5. SQL Queries (Full List)

### SELECT

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

### INSERT

```sql
INSERT INTO users(name, age) VALUES ('John', 25);
```

### UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE users SET age = 30 WHERE id = 1;
```

### DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

### JOIN

```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount
FROM users
JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

---

# ✅ 6. NoSQL — All Ways Data Can Be Stored & Why These Exist

NoSQL = "Not Only SQL" → more flexibility than relational DB.

### ✅ Four Major Types

## 1) **Document DB** (MongoDB)

* Stores JSON-like documents
* Flexible schema
* Great for content, profiles

## 2) **Key-Value DB** (Redis, DynamoDB)

* Fastest lookup
* Works like a dictionary
* Used for caching, sessions

## 3) **Wide-Column DB** (Cassandra)

* Stores data in column families
* High write throughput
* Great for time-series

## 4) **Graph DB** (Neo4j)

* Stores nodes and edges
* Great for network relationships

---

# ✅ 7. What Is Indexing?

An index is like a book’s index: it helps find data faster.

### ✅ Without Index

DB scans every row → **slow**.

### ✅ With Index

DB jumps directly to the matching rows → **fast**.

### ✅ Types

* B-tree index
* Hash index
* Full-text index
* Composite index

### ✅ Trade-off

* Faster reads
* Slower writes (because index also updates)

---

# ✅ 8. How SQL Queries Differ From NoSQL Queries

### ✅ SQL Query Example

```sql
SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 20;
```

### ✅ NoSQL Query (MongoDB)

```js
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 20 } })
```

### ✅ Differences

| SQL             | NoSQL                |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| Structured      | Flexible             |
| JOINs supported | JOINs rare or manual |
| Schema fixed    | Schema is dynamic    |
| ACID            | BASE                 |

---

# ✅ 9. ACID vs BASE (Very Important!)

These describe how databases maintain consistency.

---

# ✅ ACID (Used by SQL DBs like PostgreSQL, MySQL)

### A → **Atomicity**

All steps succeed or none do.

### C → **Consistency**

Database always in a valid state.

### I → **Isolation**

Transactions don't interfere with each other.

### D → **Durability**

Once committed → never lost.

---

# ✅ BASE (Used by NoSQL DBs like Cassandra, DynamoDB)

### B → **Basically Available**

System remains available even under issues.

### S → **Soft State**

Data may change over time, even without new writes (due to replication).

### E → **Eventually Consistent**

All nodes will have same data *eventually*.

---

# ✅ ACID vs BASE Summary Table

| ACID                              | BASE                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Strong consistency                | Eventual consistency                  |
| Perfect for banking, transactions | Perfect for large distributed systems |
| Slower scaling                    | Easy to scale horizontally            |

---

# ✅ 10. Difference Between ORM and ODM

## ✅ ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

Used for **SQL databases**.

### ✅ Purpose

Maps programming objects → relational tables.

### ✅ Examples

* Hibernate (Java)
* TypeORM (TS)
* Sequelize (Node.js)

### ✅ When to Use ORM?

* Complex relationships
* Transaction-heavy systems
* Banking, e-commerce

---

## ✅ ODM (Object-Document Mapping)

Used for **NoSQL document DBs**.

### ✅ Purpose

Maps programming objects → JSON documents.

### ✅ Example

* **Mongoose** (MongoDB)

### ✅ When to Use ODM?

* Schema flexibility
* Nested JSON structures
* Rapid development

---

# ✅ ORM vs ODM Table

| ORM           | ODM                |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| For SQL       | For NoSQL          |
| Fixed schema  | Flexible schema    |
| Tables + rows | Documents (JSON)   |
| JOIN-friendly | Embedding-friendly |
